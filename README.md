Linked List Code
=================
#Description: 
This project contains a doubly linked list class that can be used as a base for other classes such as stacks and queues. There are also stack and queue classes in the project.

##Purpose
  
The purpose of this project was to build a Doubly-linked list class that could be used to implement stacks and queues.

##Classes  
 *  Node  
   * Nodes hold the data for the list and contain two pointers, one to look backin the list and one to look forward in the list  
   * Nodes have functions to get the next and previous items in the list and to return the data it holds.  
  * DLList 
   * DLList has "Front" and "Back" Node pointers to watch the ends of the list.  
   * DLLists are doubly-linked lists that have push and pop capabilites at both ends of he list.  
 * Stack  
  * Stack objects contain a DLList object to store information.  
  * Stack objects call a set of "pop" and "push" operations from the DLList class to dislplay Stack behaviour.  
 * Queue  
  * Queue objects contain a DLLIst object as well.  
  * Queue objects call a set of "pop" and "push" operations from the DLLIst class to display Queue behaviour.
